# Sixth Workshop on Heterogeneity and Memory Systems (HMEM 2025)

### In conjunction with [SC'25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/), St. louis, MO, Nov 16–21


## Overview and scope

Heterogeneity is ubiquitous, not only in terms of processing units but also memories and networks. As heterogeneity increases, memory subsystems play an even more important role to attain performance, from their technology to the system architecture to the software management and programming model. While CPU-only compute nodes are becoming rare instances, heterogeneous memory architectures have recently emerged and revolutionized the traditional memory hierarchy. Today’s and upcoming architectures may well comprise multiple memory technologies next to DRAM, accelerators with dedicated memories, or even specific expansion cards hosting memory alone, such as: 3D-stacked memory, high-bandwidth multi-channel RAM, unified/shared memory on accelerators, Compute Express Link (CXL)-based architectures, persistent memory, or MRDIMMs.

As in previous years, the Workshop on Heterogeneous Memory Systems, now rebranded as Heterogeneity and Memory Systems (HMEM), will bring together different research efforts and expertise to the end of integrating different approaches and democratizing the use of resource heterogeneity from a memory perspective, to benefit applications not only in terms of performance, but also energy efficiency and cost trade-offs. The main goal of the workshop is to push the research frontiers forward by exchanging knowledge and debating ideas through featured talks, technical paper presentations, and interactive discussions. Overall, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Resource heterogeneity (e.g., accelerators) and memory implications, including memory designs, data layouts, etc. 
- Data allocation and placement techniques in heterogeneous memory systems 
- Caching for heterogeneous memory systems 
- Programming models and tools for complex/heterogeneous memory hierarchies 
- Software-defined far memories
- Disaggregated memory and in-memory computing 
- Data movement in heterogeneous memory systems 
- Memory consistency and persistency models 
- Data structures for heterogeneous memory infrastructures 
- Abstractions and support for failure-atomicity in persistent memory 
- Emerging memory architectures and system configurations 
-	AI on heterogeneous memory systems and use of AI for heterogeneous memory systems
- Use cases, early experiences and performance evaluations

## Submissions

This is a traditional-style workshop without formal proceedings. 
The authors of accepted submissions will give a talk at the workshop and participate in the closing discussion panel. Additionally, authors will be invited to (optionally) upload their submitted paper (PDF) to be shared on the workshop website. 
A paper accepted to the HMEM workshop does not preclude its future publication at a major conference.

Submissions must use the [ACM proceedings template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (for Latex users, version 1.90 (last update April 4, 2023) is the latest template, and please use the “sigconf” option). 

We accept two types of submissions.

A first type of submission includes position papers as well as papers that describe completed or early-stage work.
Such submissions are limited to 12 pages including references and figures.  
Extra pages can be included in a clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the reviewers).
Submitted papers must not include author names (double-blind review).

We also welcome 2-page abstracts that summarize recently accepted/published at top-tier conferences/journals. In this case, the author names and references to the published works should be included in the abstract.

Submit your paper here: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org](https://submissions.supercomputing.org)
