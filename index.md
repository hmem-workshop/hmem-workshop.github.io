# 4th Workshop on Heterogeneous Memory Systems (HMEM 2023)

### In conjunction with [SC'23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org), Denver, CO, USA, November 17th, 2023


## Overview and scope

The 4th HMEM workshop serves as a forum to present and discuss ongoing research around heterogeneous memory systems. The scope of the workshop encompasses all the layers of system and software stack, from computer architectures, operating system, middleware, programming models, runtime systems, tools, to applications.

Heterogeneous memory infrastructure design has become a dominating trend in today's HPC scene. Different memory technologies are emerging such as: NVM, HBM, Persistent memories, and CXL, that can help mitigate the memory bottleneck by offering opportunities for benefiting applications that process large amounts of data. Such opportunities can be realized across all the layers of system and software stack: from computer architectures, operating system, middleware, programming models, runtime systems, tools, up to applications.

As in previous years, the Workshop on Heterogeneous Memory Systems (HMEM) will bring together different research efforts and expertise to the end of integrating different approaches and democratizing the use of heterogeneous memory systems to benefit applications not only in terms of performance, but also energy efficiency, and cost-tradeoffs. The main goal of the workshop is to push the research frontiers forward by exchanging knowledge and debating ideas through keynote speeches, technical paper presentations, and interactive discussions. Overall, topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

- Data allocation and placement techniques in heterogeneous memories
- Caching for heterogeneous memories
- Programming Model and Tools for complex/heterogeneous memory hierarchies
- Software-defined far memories
- Disaggregated memory and in-memory computing
- Data movement in heterogeneous memory systems 
- Memory consistency and persistency models
- Data structures for heterogeneous memory infrastructures
- Abstractions and support for failure-atomicity in persistent memory
- Use cases, early experiences and performance evaluations 

## Submissions

This is a traditional-style workshop without formal proceedings. The authors of accepted submissions will give a talk at the workshop and participate in the closing discussion panel. Additionally, authors will be invited to (optionally) upload their submitted paper (PDF) to be shared on the workshop website.

Submissions consist of papers using the [ACM proceedings template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). 
Submissions are limited to 12 pages including references and figures.  
Extra pages can be included in a clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the reviewers).
Submitted papers must not include author names (double-blind review).

We also welcome submissions of papers that have been recently accepted/published at top-tier conferences/journals, provided the submission is adapted according to the format above.

The submission link will be available soon.
